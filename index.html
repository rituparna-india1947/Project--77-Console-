        <p>The Visual Studio integrated development environment is a creative launching pad that you can use to edit, debug, and build 
            code, and then publish an app. An integrated development environment (IDE) is a feature-rich program that can be used for 
            many aspects of software development. Over and above the standard editor and debugger that most IDEs provide, Visual Studio 
            includes compilers, code completion tools, graphical designers, and many more features to ease the software development 
            process.

            Windows Console is the infrastructure for console applications in Microsoft Windows. An instance of a Windows Console has a 
            screen buffer and an input buffer. It allows console apps to run inside a window or in hardware text mode (so as to occupy 
            the entire screen). The user can switch between the two using the Alt+â†µ Enter key combination. The text mode is unavailable 
            in Windows Vista and later. Starting with Windows 10, however, a native full-screen mode is available.
            <br>
            Windows Console instances are typically used for apps that do not need to display images but might use color. Examples 
            include cmd.exe, Windows PowerShell, Far Manager, and Midnight Commander.
